## RNA-seq library preparation

The starting point of a RNA-seq experiment is the cDNA library
preparation.  RNA is first isolated from cells and purified to remove
ribosomal RNA which constitute the majority of total RNA. This can be
done by extracting poly(A) RNA or by depleting rRNA. Purified RNA is then
fragmented, reverse transcribed and adapters are ligated to both extremities
to allow for amplification and sequencing.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/Unstranded_lib_prep.png")
```


### Stranded versus unstranded libraries

The library preparation presented above corresponds to an **unstranded protocol**.

As both cDNA strands will be amplified for sequencing, about half of the
reads will be sequenced from the first cDNA strand, and half of the reads will
be sequenced from the second strand cDNA. But we won't know which strand was
sequenced! So we lose the information about the orientation of the transcript.

This can be avoided by using a **stranded protocol**.
In this case, dUTPs are added during the 2nd strand cDNA synthesis and the
newly synthetized cDNA strand is degradated after the ligation step.
This allows to infer the transcript orientation because only the first cDNA strand
will be sequenced. Indeed, if the sequence of the read corresponds to the
the sense strand of DNA, it means that the gene was originally transcribed in a
sense orientation. On the contrary, if the read is complementary to the sense
strand of DNA, it means that it was originally transcribed in antisense.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/stranded_vs_unstranded.png")
```

Strand-specificity leads to lower number of ambiguous reads.

## Sequencing

### SE vs PE sequencing

Once the library is ready, molecules from the library are sequenced in
a high throughput manner to obtain short sequences from one end
(single-end sequencing) or both ends (pair-end sequencing). Single-end
sequencing is cheaper, but Paired-end sequencing improves the ability
to localise the fragment in the genome and resolve mapping close to
repeat regions, resulting in less multimapping reads.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align ='center', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/SE_vs_PE.png")
```

### cluster amplification

The sequencing is done by a cluster amplification process.

The library preparation is hybridized to a flow cell coated with
immobilized oligonucleotides that serve as support to hold the DNA
strands in place during sequencing. The templates are copied from the
hybridized primers by 3’ extension using a high-fidelity DNA
polymerase. The original templates are denatured, leaving the copies
immobilized on the flow cell surface.

Immobilized DNA template copies are then amplified by bridge
amplification. The templates loop over to hybridize to adjacent
oligonucleotides. DNA polymerase copies the templates from the
hybridized oligonucleotides, forming dsDNA bridges, which are
denatured to form two ssDNA strands. These two strands loop over and
hybridize to adjacent oligonucleotides and are extended again to form
two new dsDNA loops.  The process is repeated on each template by
cycles of denaturation and amplification to create millions of
individual, dense clonal clusters containing ~2,000 molecules.

Each cluster of dsDNA bridges is denatured, and the reverse strand is
removed by specific base cleavage, leaving the forward DNA strand. The
3’-ends of the DNA strands and flow cell-bound oligonucleotides are
blocked to prevent interference with the sequencing reaction. The
sequencing primer is hybridised to the Illumina adapter. Clusters are
ready for sequencing.


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align ='center', out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/cluster_amplification.png")
```

The sequencing process is done by synthesis.  A polymerase adds a
fluorescently tagged dNTP to the DNA strand (only one base is able to
be added per round due to the fluorophore acting as a blocking group,
but the blocking group is reversible). Each of the four bases has a
unique fluorophore, and after each round, the machine records which
base was added. The fluorophore is then washed away and the process is
repeated.

For a dynamic view of the cluster amplification process, watch the
[Illumina video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMyCqWhwB8E).

## fastq files

The sequence data generated from the sequencer are received in text
files called `fastq` files.  For a single-end run, one fastq file is
created for each sample. For a paired-end run, two separated fastq
files are generated, each containing sequences from one end.

What does a FASTQ file look like?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
try(rWSBIM2122::prepare_shell())
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align ='center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fastq_first_lines.png")
```

Each entry in a fastq file consists of 4 lines:

- A sequence identifier (by convention preceded by '@') with
  information about the sequencing run
- The sequence
- A delimiter, always starting by the sign '+'
- The base call quality scores. These are Phred scores, encoded using
  [ASCII characters](https://theasciicode.com.ar) to represent the
  numerical quality scores.  Each character is assigned a quality
  score between 0 and 40. Quality scores represent the probability
  that the corresponding nucleotide call is correct.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/phred_score.png")
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

What do you think of the quality of the last sequence presented in the
fastq file above?

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

## Processing pipeline

The raw reads from fastq files will need to pass through a different
tools to yield ultimately a count table, representing a snapshot of
individual gene expression levels.  The execution of this set of tools
in a specified order is commonly referred to as a pipeline.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/pipeline.png")
```

### Quality control

Of course, no one will analyse the sequences from the fastq file one
by one to check their quality... Rather, a software called
[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
can be used. Then, another program such as
[Trimmomatics](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) can
help to clean the reads.

- **FastQC**

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
allows to analyse different features of the reads and generates a
report that includes several diagnostic plots to highlight any problem
the data may have.

FastQC is run from the command line:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
$ fastqc SampleName.fastq
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

### Discussion: 

Try to interpret the different plots of this
[fastQC report](./OD01_10_1_fastqc.html)
from a real RNA-seq fastq file.

Another report corresponding to [bad
quality](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/bad_sequence_fastqc.html)
data can be used as a point of comparison. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::




- **Trimmomatics**

FastQC gives a global vision the quality of the sample. If it is not
optimal, it is advisable to use
[Trimmomatics](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic)
software to filter poor quality reads and trim residual adapters.

Trimmomatics has a variety of options to clean the reads. Read the
[manual](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/TrimmomaticManual_V0.32.pdf)
for more information. However, a command for Trimmomatics could look
something like the command below.  In this case it would perform
adapter removal, and perform a scan of the read with a 10-base wide
sliding window, cutting when the average quality per base drops below
20.

```
$ java -jar trimmomatic.jar \
  PE \                                  # paired-end
  -threads 4 \                          # number of threads
  SampleName_1.fastq \                  # fastq file for fw reads
  SampleName_2.fastq  \                 # fastq file for rev reads
  SampleName_1_clean.fastq \            # clean fastq for fw reads
  SampleName_1_unpaired.fastq \         # fastq for unpaired remaining fw reads
  SampleName_2_clean.fastq \            # clean fastq for rev reads
  SampleName_2_unpaired.fastq \         # fastq for unpaired remaining rev reads
  ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10 \  # cut adapter from the read.
  SLIDINGWINDOW:10:20                   # sliding window trimming
```

### Discussion: 

How could you check that the trimming performed well?

## Alignment


Next step is to map the reads to determine where in the genome the
reads originated from.  Many different aligners are available such as
[HISAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/manual.shtml),
[STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR),
[BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net),
[Salmon](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/),
[Subread](https://sourceforge.net/projects/subread/)...  There is no
gold standard, but some tools are better suited for particular NGS
analyses [@Baruzzo:2017]... In the case of RNA-seq, it is important to
use an aligner able to handle spliced reads.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%', purl = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/spliced_alignment.png")
```


Here we show an example of what the command could look like when using
[HISAT2](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/) aligner,
launched with default parameters.  In this basic configuration,
mandatory parameters are of course the fastq file(s) and the sequence
of the genome on which the reads have to be aligned. In practical, the
genome's sequence is not given as it is but in an indexed form
[^Indexed_genome]. Of course many of other parameters can be fine
tuned (see the
[manual](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/manual/) for more
details).  The alignment output file data is a `sam` file (see below).

[^Indexed_genome]: Genome indexing allows the aligner to quickly find
potential alignment sites for query sequences in a genome, which saves
considerable time during alignment. Frequently used genome (human,
mouse, rat...) already have indexed versions that can be downloaded
directly. When working with another reference genome, a specific
indexed genome has to be built.


```
$ hisat2 \
  -p 6 \                        # number of threads
  -x genome_index \             # index for the reference genome
  -1 SampleName_1_clean.fastq \ # clean fastq_file for fw reads
  -2 SampleName_2_clean.fastq \ # clean fastq_file for rev reads
  -S SampleName.sam             # sam file name
```

It is recommended to pay attention to the HISAT2 report to check the
alignment rate.  For a PE-end alignment it could look like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '50%', purl = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/hisat2_report.png")
```

**SAM format**

The [SAM](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/SAM) format is a generic
format for storing large nucleotide sequence alignments.
In a SAM file, each entry gives the alignment information for a single read.
Each entry has 11 mandatories fields for essential mapping information
and a variable number of other fields for aligner specific information.
An example of few entries from a SAM
file is displayed below.

```{bash}
head data/example.sam
```

Field 1: Sequence ID

Field 2: [SAM Flag](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html). It gives information about
the read (is it paired, aligned, is the mate read properly aligned...)

Field 3: Chromosome where alignment occurs

Field 4: Position of alignment

Field 5: Mapping quality score (read uniquely mapped (60), multiply mapped (1) or unmapped (0))

Field 6: [CIGAR](https://timd.one/blog/genomics/cigar.php)
string. It is a representation of alignment indicating positions of match/mismatch/deletion/insertion
compared to the reference.

Field 7: Reference name of the mate (Set to '=' if the mate’s reference sequence is the same as this alignment’s)

Field 8: Position of mate

Field 9: Inferred fragment length

Field 10: Read sequence (reverse-complemented if aligned to the reverse strand)

Field 11: Base quality (Phred score)

Field 12: Optional. See [hisat2 manual](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/manual/) for more information.

**BAM format**

The BAM file is a compressed binary version of SAM file. SAM files can be
easily converted into BAM files using [samtools](http://www.htslib.org
software), and it is sometimes mandatory to sort the SAM/BAM by
chromosomal coordinates for downstream applications.

```
samtools view -Sb SampleName.sam | samtools sort > SampleName.bam
```

**Alignment visualisation**

Alignements described in BAM files can easily be viewed using
[IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) (Integrative Genomics Viewer),
a very useful interactive tool for the visual exploration of genomic data.

Visualising the alignments is not part of the processing pipeline
but sometimes it can be useful..



IGV requires that BAM files have an associated index file[^Indexed_bam].
Samtools can be used to index the BAM file. The following command would create
the indexed SampleName.bam.bai file.

[^Indexed_bam]: Indexing a BAM file allows IGV to quickly extract alignments overlapping
particular genomic regions

```
samtools index SampleName.bam
```

Bam file can be loaded in IGV[^note_on_index].
Below is an example of visualisation of a bam file using IGV, focusing on CDKN1A gene.

[^note_on_index]: Note that the index file must reside in the same directory as the bam
file that it indexes, and it must have the same basename

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', purl = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/IGV.png")
```


Loading a BAM file creates 3 associated tracks:

- Coverage Track to view depth of coverage

- Splice Junction Track which provides an alternative view of reads spanning splice junctions

- Alignment Track to view individual aligned reads


## Counting



Now comes the quantification step. It can be performed with several
tools such as [htseq-count](https://pypi.org/project/HTSeq/) or
[FeatureCounts](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/).  We will
describe the latter as it runs much faster. It was developed for
counting reads to genomic features such as genes, exons, promoters and
genomic bins.  FeatureCounts takes as input SAM/BAM files and an
annotation file (such as a gtf file) containing chromosomal
coordinates of features.

The Gene Transfer Format (GTF) is a widely used format for storing
gene annotations.  Human and mouse GTF files can be downloaded easily
from [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html) or
from the [UCSC table
browser](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/). The first few lines of
gtf annotation file for human genome assembly GRCh38 look like this:


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', purl = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/gtf_example.png")
```

FeatureCounts will count the number of uniquely mapped reads assigned
to features (e.g. an exon) or meta-features (e.g. a gene) of the gtf
file. When summarizing reads at gene level, read counts obtained for
exons belonging to the same gene will be added up to yield the read
count for the corresponding gene.  Note that an exon-spanning read
will be counted only once for the corresponding gene even if it
overlaps with more than one exon.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%', purl = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/featurecount_metafeature.png")
```

FeatureCounts could be launched with the following command.  As usual,
many of other parameters can be fine-tuned (see the
[manual](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/featureCounts.1.html)
for more details).

```
featureCounts \
-p \                        # paired-end
--countReadPairs \          # fragments counted instead of reads
-a annotations.gtf \        # name of the annotation file
-t exon \                   # feature type in GTF annotation
-g gene_id \                # Meta-features used in GTF annotation
-s 0 \                      # strand-specificity
-o SampleName_counts.tsv \  # Name of the output file
SampleName.bam              # bam file
```

The featurecounts output file will give us the raw counts of each gene in that sample.




## Preparing the count matrix

The aim of an RNA-seq experiment is often to compare different types of
cells, or to compare treated cells to control cells, to see if some
genes are up- or down- regulated.

Once fastq files from each sample have been processed into raw counts,
results can be merged in a single count matrix, were each column represents a sample,
and each line represents a gene. This count matrix will be the starting point of a
differential expression analysis.

```{r}
counts <- read.csv("data/GSE96870_counts_cerebellum.csv", 
                   row.names = 1)
head(counts)
```
